# Famitsu Vocab

This project aims to facilitate reading issues of gaming mags (mostly [Famitsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famitsu), mostly old issues) in Japanese by providing vocab lists and helpful phrases.

I don't claim that this is a good idea or useful in any way. It just scratches an itch that I get to look at old issues of Famitsu.
